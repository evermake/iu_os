I tried to create a sequence with length 100 of 5 different numbers, and run the
program with page frame size equal to 5.
The resulting hit/miss ratio was 5/95. 5 misses will occur anyway, since
we access these pages first time, but the rest of the time all pages will be in memory,
so we will all remaining 95 times get a hit.
