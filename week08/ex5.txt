Physical address is the address of the memory cell in the RAM (hardware), where the data is actually stored while PC is running. We cannot access a physical address that is outside of actual RAM capacity.
Virtual address, on the other hand, is an address that helps an OS to find data that can be located in RAM (but virtual address will not necessarily match the actual physical address) or this data can be on the disk at the moment of request, in which case data should be swapped first. Therefore we can have much more available virtual addresses than available physical addresses.
