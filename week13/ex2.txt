Deadlock recovery has an advantage that it is not so difficult to implement,
but it has a big drawback: we can break the programs flow and get unwanted results.

Deadlock avoidance requires to analyze each resource request and know
something about the future behaviour of the programs. The main disadvantage
of this approach is that it is usually impossible to implement, since
we do not know anything about the processes future.

Deadlock prevention has a same goal as deadlock avoidance â€“ prevent
system from entering deadlock state. It has an advantage that it is
possible to implement, but it has a disadvantage that it is
requires modifying programs or introduce some new mechanisms,
which just makes the system more complex and decreases performance.
