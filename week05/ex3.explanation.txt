For m=1 the number of prime numbers was counted in one thread,
so we get the real time and CPU time used (user) almost equal to 3.8 seconds.

Increasing m to 2 and 4 decreases the waiting time, but increases CPU time in the user mode,
because besides counting prime numbers in one thread CPU alse execute instrucitons to manage threads,
that is why CPU time in user mode increases. CPU usage time increases, but now its
distributed between multiple cores (since we have multiple threads) that is why the waiting time decreases.

Increasing m from 4 to 10 increases CPU usage time even more and also decreases waiting time,
because my machine has 8 cores.
For m = 4, 4 cores were free.
For m = 10, 8 cores were busy.

Increasing m from 10 to 100 roughly speaking did not affect the waiting time, but have increased
CPU usage time, because CPU should often switch between threads to finish the program,
because only 8 threads out of 100 can run at one moment.
